This assignment uses jflex to split a SGML formatted file into a 
sequence of tokens.

Compilation
-----------
    - In addition to all the .java files listed in the makefile, make 
      sure that "article.flex" is present in the root directory.

    - Compile in root directory with "make". This will generate all java
      .class files necessary to run the program.

Usage
-----
    - Run the Scanner program to generate all the SGML tokens like so:
      java Scanner < {SGML_FILE}

Known Limitations
-----------------
    - Program only outputs tag for the listed relevant tags: doc, text,
      date, doc no, headline, and length.

    - Regular expressions defined in JFlex depend on SGML formatting.

Further Changes
---------------
    - If more time was provided I would:
        - Improve my JFlex spec to handle more obscure cases for tokens
          such as hyphenated and apostrophized.

Test Plan
---------
    - This test plan tests for correctness by examining differences in
      what was tokenized programmatically and the manual classificaion. 
      All tests are done with files in the "./test" directory.

    (1) apostrophized.txt
        Match lines 1-7

    (2) closetag.txt
        Match lines 3, 4, 6-12

    (3) hyphenated.txt
        Match lines 1, 2, 4, 5, 7

    (4) number.txt
        Match lines 1-7, 9-14

    (5) opentag.txt
        Match lines 2-13, 15-16

    (6) word.txt
        Match lines 1-4

    (7) open-tag2.txt
        Parse with 0 unmatched tokens

    (8) newsdata.txt
        Parse with 0 unmatched tokens
